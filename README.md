# Impractical Python ProjectsAs a part of learning python, It's important to make lots of projects myself no matter how small or impractical. This repository contains all the project work I have done when working through the book *Impractical Python Projects* by Lee Vaughan![Impractical Python Projects Book by Lee Vaughan](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/IPJ.jpg?raw=true)### Chapter 1 - Silly Name Generatorthe program begins by generating a silly nickname for the user.If the user doesn't like that nickname, they simply press enter to generate a new one![End of Silly Name Generator Program](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterOne_2.png?raw=true)It's just as easy as the press of a button to generate a nickname or quit the program### Chapter 2- Finding Palingram spellsThere were a lot of little projects involved in this chapter Palindromes.py required a custom module called load_dictionary.py and a text file full of words in the English language called dictionary.txt. Palindromes.py used these files to find and display palindromes in the English language![Screenshot of Palindromes.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterTwo_1.png?raw=true)Palingrams.py also used the same dictionary files, but now the program found word pairs of palindromes, called palingrams. Examples include "race car" and "nurses run" because the phrases spell the same way forwards and backwards.![Screenshot of Palingrams.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterTwo_2.png?raw=true)The solution for this code initially had a runtime of about 3 minutes. This issue was solved easily by using sets as opposed to lists to check whether a certain word existed in the dictionary or not and now the runtime is under a second. Optimizing code like this to improve runtime is part of the iterative coding process.### Chapter 3 - Solving AnagramsFirst, this chapter gave the task of creating a program that loads the same dictionary file as the last chapter. My version of the program takes a word as user input, and displays all anagrams found in the dictionary. I also refactored the code into a function so that the function can easily be called over and over again, so the user can continue to use the program until they choose to quit.![Screenshot of anagrams.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterThree_1.png?raw=true)Next, this chapter gave the task of creating a program that, instead of finding anagrams that are single words, the user can input their name, and interactively create a phrase which is an anagram of the user's name. I entered the name "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle", the author of the _Sherlock Holmes_ series. With more tries and more time, I could probably come up with something more sensible, but as you can see, I've found the anagram "actual horror side" from "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle".![first Screenshot of anagramPhrases.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterThree_2.png?raw=true)![Second Screenshot of anagramPhrases.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterThree_3.png?raw=true)![Third Screenshot of anagramPhrases.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterThree_4.png?raw=true)![Fourth Screenshot of anagramPhrases.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterThree_5.png?raw=true)### Chapter 4 - Decoding American Civil War CiphersIn this chapter there is routeCipherDecrypt.py which works on the idea of route transposition ciphers such as those used during the American civil war. Transposition ciphers involve taking a plaintext (our "real" message) then putting the words in that plaintext into a matrix, and by essentially "transposing" the way we read the words in the matrix, we get a reconstruction of our original message (a cipher text). To show this transposition in python, we start with a certain cipher text that has no meaning and you can see that the resulting plain text is in a different arrangement. The arrangement can be changed simply by changing the numbers of the rows and columns of the matrix we will use, and even a key to indicate in what order we will read along the matrix. ![Screenshot of routeCipherDecrypt.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterFour_1.png?raw=true)![Screenshot of routeCipherDecrypt.py](https://github.com/BrosephB/Impractical-Python-Projects/blob/main/Readme/ChapterFour_2.png?raw=true)### Chapter 5 - Encoding English Civil War Ciphers### Chapter 6 - Writing in Invisible Ink### Chapter 7 - Breeding Giant Rats with Genetic Algorithms### Chapter 8 - Counting Syllables for Haiku Poetry### Chapter 9 - Writing Haiku with Markov Chain Analysis### Chapter 10 - Are We Alone?
